My field of research is Galactic Archaeology and Dynamics. I think stellar streams are awesome objects, and am interested in figuring out more about the dark component of our Universe using their dynamics. 

Click [here](helmi_streams.md) for videos that are part of my work on the Helmi Streams! We used their peculiar dynamics to constrain the shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo.
