Hi! I am a fourth year PhD student at the [Kapteyn Astronomical Institute](https://www.rug.nl/research/kapteyn/?lang=en) in Groningen, the Netherlands, working with [Amina Helmi](https://www.astro.rug.nl/~ahelmi/dev/) on Galactic Archaeology and Dynamics. I'm particularly interested in the dynamics of (phase mixed) stellar streams and halo stars. Currently, I am working with an awesome suite of [constrained Local Group simulations](https://ewoudwempe.com/).
