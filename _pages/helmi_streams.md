title: "The Helmi Streams in a Triaxial Galactic Potential"
classes: wide
---

These videos are part of a soon-to-be-submitted work that investigates the dynamical properties of the Helmi Streams, and uses those to constrain the Milky Way's Galactic potential. In particular, we constrain the dark matter halo's shape and characteristic parameters, and the Milky Way's total disc mass. These videos show a Helmi Streams-like progenitor in Galactic potentials with a triaxial NFW halo, whose shape is set by the parameters *p* (ratio *y* to *x* axis) and *q* (ratio *z* to *x* axis):
