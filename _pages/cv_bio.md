I am a fourth year PhD student at the [Kapteyn Astronomical Institute](https://www.rug.nl/research/kapteyn/?lang=en) in Groningen, the Netherlands, working with [Amina Helmi](https://www.astro.rug.nl/~ahelmi/dev/) on Galactic Archaeology and Dynamics. I did all of my undergraduate studies at the University of Groningen, starting with a bachelor's degree in Astronomy, followed by a year of Art History and finally a master's degree in Astronomy.
